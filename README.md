# Abes-Website
Built for owner of Abe's Pizzas and Subs, however they would not accept it and choose to use and outdated website.

This site was created by myself with little guidelines from the person who was requesting it.
It was completed and turned down becasue it was not what the person wanted even though they gave me little guidelines.
Trying to fix it, I was shut down and told to stop working on it.
When connected to a MySQL server you can use the log in feature added to the site.

Since this is all my code, i have posted it here to show that I have the skills to make a website for a company that looks and feels nice.
